If I have structured my application to import from the root directory, I have to add the root directory to the pythonpath searched by the Python runtime launched by alembic.

```python
# migrations/env.py

import os, sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.realpath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..')))
```
